# ðŸ“Š Market Risk Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project provides several implementations for analyzing **market risk**, structured around three main areas:

---

### 1. Microstructural Impact of Financial Markets

- Study of **permanent and temporary price impact** caused by order flow.
- Linear regression estimation and modeling using the **Almgren-Chriss algorithm** for optimal execution strategies.

---

### 2. Value-at-Risk (VaR) Estimation and Validation

- **Empirical methods** based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF).
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** to better approximate the return distribution.
- **Out-of-sample validation** of the estimated VaR.

---

### 3. Option Pricing and Risk Management

- **European call option pricing** using the **Black-Scholes model**.
- **Monte Carlo simulations** of financial asset price paths.
- **VaR computation on options** to assess potential losses under different market scenarios.
